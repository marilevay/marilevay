## Hi, I'm Marina 👋

I'm a junior at [Minerva University](https://www.minerva.edu/) studying Computer Science and Math.

🌱 My interests range from AI hackathons to mathematical modeling and geometry processing research.  
🖥️ Currently, I'm enjoying working on projects briging theory in topology and optimal transport into computational applications. 

[Here](https://marilevay.github.io/mywebsite/) are a few things I've worked on over the years.
